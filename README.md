# PyMicroTracer
This is a trace-based micro-architecture simulator. This framework is able to approximate 
both static, dynamic ILPs at this phase. This is the continues work, so please be ready for more updated :)

You can test application by following code:
`./main.py ./example/arch/arm/hello_trace.db 100 5,6 ./example/arch/arm/res/ hello`

This framework needs some other open-source tools to be installed. I am going to create a wiki page
how to install them.
